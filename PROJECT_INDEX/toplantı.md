# Aviation Parts Management System - Implementation Plan

## Meeting Summary
**Date:** Based on transcript analysis  
**Participants:** Salih (Domain Expert), Akif,  Eshagh (Development Lead)
**Purpose:** System requirements review and enhancement planning

## Executive Summary
This implementation plan addresses critical improvements to the aviation parts management system based on comprehensive user feedback. The system manages the complete lifecycle of aviation parts from purchase through repair to sales, with strict compliance requirements for documentation and traceability.

## Current System Analysis

### Core Business Process
1. **Purchase Order** � Inventory Entry
2. **Repair Order** (optional) � Part modification and status updates
3. **Sales Order** � Customer fulfillment
4. **Document Generation** � Invoice/Proforma, Packing Slip, ATA 106

### Critical Issues Identified
- Template optimization needed (oversized signatures, unnecessary content)
- Status display bugs in generated documents
- Manual refresh requirements throughout interface
- Incomplete data flow from Purchase Orders to Sales Orders
- Inventory status tracking limitations
- Part number modification handling during repair

## Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (2-3 weeks)
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Required for stable operations

### Template Optimization
- **Issue:** Documents too large, multi-page when should be single-page
- **Solution:** Optimize PDF templates, reduce signature section size
- **Impact:** Improved document quality, reduced printing costs
- **Files:** PDF generation components, template CSS

### Status Display Corrections
- **Issue:** "Draft" status appearing in final documents
- **Solution:** Filter status information from download versions
- **Impact:** Professional document appearance
- **Files:** Document generation logic

### Interface Refresh Issues
- **Issue:** Manual refresh required after operations
- **Solution:** Implement automatic state updates
- **Impact:** Better user experience, reduced errors
- **Files:** React state management, API integration

### Data Flow Improvements
- **Issue:** Country of Origin and End Use not flowing from Purchase Orders
- **Solution:** Automatic data inheritance between related records
- **Impact:** Reduced manual data entry, improved accuracy
- **Files:** Database relations, API endpoints

## Phase 2: Core Enhancements (6-8 weeks)
**Priority:** HIGH - Essential for improved operations

### Proforma vs Invoice Generation
- **Business Need:** Customer requirements vary by region/company
- **Solution:** Toggle option for document type with same format, different headers
- **Implementation:** Add document type selection to Sales Order creation
- **Files:** PDF generation templates, Sales Order forms

### Part Number Management System
- **Requirements:**
  - Full descriptions AND abbreviations for each part
  - Dynamic part creation during data entry
  - Dropdown selection with create-new capability

- **Database Changes:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE part_numbers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    part_number VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    full_description TEXT NOT NULL,
    abbreviation VARCHAR,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

  ### Dual Inventory Status System
  - **Current:** Single status field
  - **Required:** Two-dimensional tracking
    - **Physical Status:** Depot, In-Repair, In-Transit
    - **Business Status:** Available, Reserved, Sold
  - **Use Cases:**
    - Reserved parts not yet physically received
    - Parts in repair but already sold
    - Complete lifecycle visibility

  ### Part Number Modification During Repair
  - **Business Case:** Software upgrades change part numbers (e.g., 350-0530-2818 � 350-0530-2323)
  - **Requirements:**
    - Track original and modified part numbers
    - Update inventory automatically
    - Maintain traceability chain
    - Generate proper documentation with new part numbers
  - **Implementation:** Repair Order enhancement with part number change capability

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (10-12 weeks)
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Optimization and scaling features

### Customer PO Integration

  - Advanced inventory allocation
  - Cross-reference reporting

### Complete Document Package Generation
- **Requirements:**
  - PDF merging for "Full Trace Paperwork"
  - Combine supplier documents + generated documents
  - Single download for complete compliance package
  - Document validation and completeness checking

### Advanced Workflow Management
- **Sales Order Workflow:** Draft � Reserved � In Progress � Completed
- **Document Generation Triggers:** Automatic creation based on workflow state
- **Quality Gates:** Validation before progression to next stage
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of changes and approvals

### Enhanced Traceability Features
- **Aviation Requirements:**
  - Remove Tag documentation
  - Bill of Sale tracking
  - NIS (Non-Incident Statement) management
  - Aircraft MSN and registration number validation
  - Complete chain of custody documentation

## Phase 4: AI/OCR Integration (6+ months)
**Priority:** FUTURE - Automation and scaling

### Document Processing Automation
- **OCR Integration:** Automatic reading of supplier documents
- **Data Extraction:** MSN numbers, part numbers, serial numbers, dates
- **Validation:** Cross-reference document information
- **Quality Control:** Missing document detection and alerts

### Business Process Automation
- **Smart Data Flow:** Automatic Purchase Order to Sales Order inheritance
- **Predictive Features:** Part number suggestions, compliance checking
- **Document Generation:** AI-assisted template completion
- **Audit Automation:** Regulatory compliance validation

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
